Mitochondrial Genes,"The <a href='https://ensembl.org'>ENSEMBL database</a> provides the chromosome name for all human and mouse genes. Genes on the mitochondrial chromosome (as identified by the ENSEMBL database) were annotated as mitochondrial."
Hemoglobin Genes,"Similarly, the ENSEMBL database provides descriptions for many genes. Genes containing the world 'hemoglobin' in the description were annotated as hemoglobin genes."
Sex-linked Genes,"Genes on the Y-chromosome in the ENSEMBL database were marked as sex-linked, along with the X-inactivation gene, known as <i>Xist</i> in both mice and humans."
Ribosomal Genes,"Genes with a name that starts with the following strings were annotated as ribosomal: 'Mrpl', 'Mrps', 'Rpl', 'Rps'."
Cell Cycle Genes,"For humans, genes from <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788831/bin/mjy063_supplementary_table_s3.xlsx'>this spreadsheet</a>, a part of <a href='https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6788831/'>this paper</a> were used as cell cycle genes. Note that there is a column of 'manual annotations' - genes that have a value of 'uncharacterised' in this column were ommitted from the annotation. For mice, all genes in the first two columns of <a href='https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fnature20123/MediaObjects/41586_2016_BFnature20123_MOESM100_ESM.xlsx'>this spreadsheet</a> from <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20123#Sec23'>this paper</a> were used to annotate cell cycle genes."
Stress Response Genes,"For humans, the genes in <a href='https://github.com/kieranrcampbell/scrnaseq-digestion-paper/blob/master/data/deliverables/coregene_df-FALSE-v3.csv'>this spreadsheet</a> from <a href='https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-019-1830-0'>this paper</a> were used as stress resonse genes. For mice, the genes resulting from <a href='https://www.informatics.jax.org/go/term/GO:0033554'>this search</a> were used."
