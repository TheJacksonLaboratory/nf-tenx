Generating counts,"A counts matrix is generated by <code><a href='https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/count'>cellranger count V7.0</a></code>, which also filters the counts matrix. See the <a href='static/cellranger_summary.html'>cellranger-generated web summary</a> for metrics outputted by that tool."
Filtering ambient mRNA,"Ambient RNA can contaminate droplets with non-cellular RNA. Using <code><a href='https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender'>CellBender remove-background V0.3.0</a></code>, these contaminant RNA molecules are accounted for and removed computationally. The filtered matrix generated by this tool is analagous to the one generated by <code>cellranger count</code>, so both filtered matrices will get the same treatment to generate two final files."
Annotating data,"Using <code><a href='https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html'>scanpy</a></code>, mitochondrial, ribosomal, sex-linked, hemoglobin, cell-cycle, and stress-response genes are all annotated. See <a href='#Annotation_Strategy'>the gene annotation strategy</a> for more information. Additionally, cells are identified as potential doublets with <code><a href='https://github.com/swolock/scrublet'>scrublet</a></code>.
Converting to <code>Seurat</code>-readable files,"From the <code>.h5ad</code> files generated in the prior steps, construct a directory of files that <code>Seurat</code> can read and save as <code>.h5seurat</code> files. Method adapted from <a href='https://github.com/mousepixels/sanbomics_scripts/blob/main/h5ad_to_seurat.ipynb'>this notebook</a>."
